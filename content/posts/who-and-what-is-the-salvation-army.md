description: Who and what is the Salvation Army?

By Sam Tomlin

This is the first blog to be featured on our new website! I’ve been thinking about what to write about and I thought I would focus on what is perhaps the most basic (and complicated!) thing I can think of: The Salvation Army itself.

Some of you who are reading this may not know much about the Salvation Army. I did not grow up in the Salvation Army and my understanding before I joined was that it was a charity with some Christian values behind it. I think this is what is often generally understood in by the general public. We, at Liverpool Stoneycroft Salvation Army, are in fact a church. In fact, the Salvation Army, right from the beginnings in 1865 in London, has emphasised worship of God revealed in Jesus Christ as a central part of what it is.

What does that mean for what we do? We gather for worship on Sundays in our hall on Prescot Road, we gather mid-week in people’s homes for small-groups and studying the Bible, we run various programmes including a toddler group, art and craft classes, we provide food for those in need and we aim to provide community and tackle loneliness through making weekly calls and our community lunches on Tuesdays. We have also partnered with other groups in the community and city to provide adult learning classes for instance.

During the pandemic we have obviously been more limited in what we have been able to do. We have done our food distribution every Friday morning from 11-12 and will continue doing so. Our church services have moved online to Zoom and you are very welcome to join via the following link every Sunday from 10.30am: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/279473158 - we’d love to see you!

There is of course much more to say, but I’ll leave it there for now and aim to write more about who we are in future blogs. Please do get in touch if you have any more questions about the Salvation Army nationally or locally here in Old Swan and Stoneycroft.
