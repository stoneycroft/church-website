I tried to suggest there have been few passages that have been more abused than Romans 13.1-7 in Christian history. Many Christians have used it to support oppressive political regimes from Nazi Germany to Apartheid South Africa.

What did you make of my 2 main points?

1) We need to stop *just* reading Romans 13.1-7 and read it in the wider context of chapters 12 and the rest of chapter 13. Paul seems to suggest there are different standards of behaviour for those who follow Jesus & those who don't.

2) The word submission in v.1 is not the same as 'obey'. There are many examples of followers of Jesus submitting to authority but not obeying it (e.g. John, Peter, Paul & Silas in Acts).

My questions to think about this week (and at Bible Connect on Weds evening from 7.30pm if you can make it) are:

* How should faith and politics mix?
* What does it mean to submit to secular authorities like the UK government or Liverpool Council?
* What should we do if we think that a government's commands conflict with what Jesus says? What might examples of this be?
* What did you think of what Sam said about Christians having different standards of behaviour or ethics than people who do not claim to follow Jesus?
