description: Sam spoke about the vastness of the gospel on Sunday & introduced
  us to the characters of Sin & Death

We entered a new section of the book of Romans on Sunday. Having outlined the process of justification in ch. 1-4, ch. 5-8 are all about the implications of justification. Sam spoke on Romans 5 & reflected on the following points:

* The gospel is more than justification - we are called to live new, resurrected life after we have been justified
* 'Sin' & 'Death' are personified by Paul in this chapter and throughout much of Romans. They are said to 'reign' or 'exercise dominion'. They hold all creation captive until Jesus defeats them on the cross and through the revelation
* God is much more powerful than the powers of Sin & Death, but even though the battle has already been won, the enemies of God are still fighting for our attention & allegiance. Often Paul's response to this is to 'stand firm' in Jesus.

What did you make of this? How do you understand 'powers and principalities' language? Do go along to Bible Connect this Weds on the normal church link from 7.30pm.
