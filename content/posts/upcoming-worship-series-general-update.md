description: Update on coming weeks at Stoneycroft
---
Hi all! We hope you are enjoying the sun and it's not too hot!

We recently finished our series on Romans and we hope you enjoyed it as much as we did. If you want to listen to any of the sermons again, you can find them [here](https://anchor.fm/oldswanchurch/).

Last Sunday we looked at Safeguarding and how it's a crucial part of our life together here at Stoneycroft. It's not just something the government requires us to do, but it's something that comes from the heart of God. If you want any more info about safeguarding of children and vulnerable adults, please get in touch.

This Sunday we are having our meeting outside at the Newsham Park bandstand ([here](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@53.415198,-2.9369559,19.3z) on the map). If you need a lift to get there, please do let us know & we can arrange this. We need some people to help with bringing chairs from 9.45am at the hall. Again, please let me know if you can do this.

After this, Liz & Tony Roberts are kindly hosting a church picnic in their back garden which is next to the bandstand. They will show us where to go after the meeting.

From this Sunday, we are starting a new small series on worship. See at the top for the schedule.

We also need to update you on a decision we have made. We have been in discussion with our Divisional Headquarters & seen what other SA churches are doing around the county from this Sunday. While government restrictions have officially been lifted, we have taken the decision to have a meeting at the hall every Sunday but continue with the restrictions as we have been doing - keeping restrictions of 12 people at the hall, asking people to wear masks etc.

There are two reasons for this: firstly Covid rates continue to rise and we have been asked to exercise caution to protect our people. Also, as well as being away for a few weeks in August, our Chloe is in and out of hospital at the moment and we are expecting her to have surgery some time over the coming weeks. Our capacity to make the big change of going back to the hall without any restrictions is therefore quite limited.

We will review this, and hopefully if there are no additional restrictions come September, we will be looking to open up again fully then.

As always, if you have any questions or thoughts, please let us know. We would appreciate prayers especially for Chloe as she continues to undergo tests and scans, and we wait for a date for surgery for her.

With every blessing,

Sam & Jenni
