description: Looking at Pentecost yesterday, Jenni challenged us to think about
  the Holy Spirit in our personal and collective lives

Speaking yesterday on Acts 2, Jenni [challenged us](https://anchor.fm/oldswanchurch/episodes/Acts-2---The-sending-of-the-holy-spirit-e11ekte) to consider how we act as Christians. Are we essentially just the same as other secular agencies as the Salvation Army? Do we 'help people' in the same way as anyone can, or as the body of Christ are we different?

She suggested that there was a 3-fold pattern that Peter speaks about in Acts 2:

* The Holy Spirit fell
* Repent, be baptized, receive the Holy Spirit
* We are empowered to serve a broken world

It has to be in this order. Has the Salvation Army arguably abandoned this pattern in its desire to 'do the most good?' Have we sought after human approval above that of God?

If any of these questions interest you, do come along to Bible Connect on Weds evening at 7.30pm.
