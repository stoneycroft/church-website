description: Summary of Emma's talk on Romans 12
---
Last Sunday Emma [spoke on Romans 12](https://anchor.fm/oldswanchurch/episodes/Romans-ch-12-The-role-of-Humility-in-the-new-life-that-Jesus-brings-e134ehp). She challenged us to think about 'pie' and humble pie especially. The importance of humility in our lives as Christians. This is related to the 'renewing of our minds' (Rom. 12.2) - we do not have to take part in the 'rat race' of the world because we belong to Jesus.

She has asked the following questions to think about in response to her talk, which will also be discussed at Bible Connect on Weds 23rd at 7.30pm on the normal link:

1) Verse 3 Do not think of your\[SELF\*] more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgement... Substitute \[SELF\*] with something you find challenging, eg status, knowledge, opinion, etc. Why is it challenging to you? 

2) We’re adopted into God’s family, and this means even when we’re not together, we still bear the family name. What does that mean to us **outside** of our family gatherings? Do we bring honour to our heavenly Father and to one another with our conduct? (verse 10)? If not, why not, and what would you like to see change?

I was also really struck by Emma's point about sacrifice. For normal people they might leave everything behind in a will which only becomes good when you die. We are LIVING sacrifices so we give everything we have for God and His kingdom here today.

Do listen to the talk if you weren't able to on Sunday or if you'd like a re-cap.
