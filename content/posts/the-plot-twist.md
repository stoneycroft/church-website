Romans 1.28-2.16 

I guess you’re all familiar with the concept of a plot twist?  It’s where a story continues in one direction, and then the story changes direction dramatically.  It’s like in a crime drama where you’re pretty sure that a certain person is the murderer, until the last episode where the detective reveals that it is someone completely different that you’d never even considered.  That’s what Paul does in Romans 2.  Like a master detective he’s cunning because he puts the focus on the Romans.  Then when he’s built up the argument, he makes his move and puts the focus on the Jews.

Here are some questions to consider when reading Romans 1.28-2.16:

1. Why is Paul seeming to be so harsh towards the Jews in Romans chapter 2 verse 1?
2. Paul challenges the Jews for judging the Romans.  Why does he do this?
3. How is God’s judgement different to ours?
4. Do you have judgemental attitudes towards someone where God might want you to show grace?
