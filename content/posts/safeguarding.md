Safeguarding. Just that thing the government tells us we need to worry about? Or something that at the heart of God?

Our meeting yesterday was dedicated to safeguarding. We watched a video about safeguarding vulnerable adults among us, did a quiz & I spoke from Matt. 18.1-9.

My main points were: 1) We need to be realistic that abuse happens. 2) God deeply cares for those who are vulnerable in our midst and 3) We are accountable for our actions & have responsibility to protect others.

Some questions to think about either for Bible Connect (7.30pm Weds) or in your own lives this week:

\- Why is safeguarding important in a church?

\- What responsibility do we have collectively and as individuals for safeguarding?

\- What does Jesus mean when he says we should cut out our eye if it's causing us to sin?

\- What does it mean that those like little children are considered the greatest in the kingdom?

Hope everyone has a great week!
