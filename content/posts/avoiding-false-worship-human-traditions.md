You can hear Arthur speak [here](https://anchor.fm/oldswanchurch/episodes/Avoiding-False-Worship-Mark-7-1-23-e15cb6l). He spoke powerfully on how we can accidentally put human traditions in the way of following Jesus. What ways do we do this in our own lives? It could be the clothes we wear, or particular traditions of a church. As those in the Salvation Army - I wonder what we might think about this both as an individual corps/church and a wider Salvation Army denomination?

Arthur has asked the following questions to reflect on both in Bible Connect later this evening or in your own personal reflections:

What do you think has become the traditions in todays churches? How do we take worship In to everyday life?
